                        Unauthorised users are prohibited from accessing some application modules by the ERP software. Moreover, it automates tasks at all levels which reduces the risk of errors resulting from human intervention. This eliminates concerns like incorrect data entry, updating system data, and unintentionally deleting custom formulas.

                    <p>
                    The payroll system maintains an updated computerized record of employee information, including confidential details and financial data. Therefore, it's important to implement a payroll compliance system to avoid any information leaks that could result in financial losses for both the employees and the company.
