                      Accounting software is computer software designed to
                      record, store and analyze financial transactions. It is
                      used by businesses to manage their accounts and generate
                      financial reports. It typically includes features such as
                      invoicing, budgeting, reporting, payroll, and inventory
                      management. Accounting software can help businesses with
                      their taxation and regulatory compliance needs, as well as
                      streamline the process of tracking and recording financial
                      data.
